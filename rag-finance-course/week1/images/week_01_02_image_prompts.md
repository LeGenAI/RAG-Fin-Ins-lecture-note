## 1. Morgan Stanley RAG Success Story
**Purpose**: Illustrate dramatic efficiency improvement through RAG implementation
**Prompt**: 
"Split-screen office scene showing before and after RAG implementation at investment bank. Left side: Exhausted financial analyst at 2 AM, surrounded by towering stacks of printed reports, multiple monitors with complex spreadsheets, empty coffee cups, harsh fluorescent lighting creating shadows. Right side: Same analyst at 10 AM, relaxed posture, single elegant holographic display showing key insights floating in air, natural sunlight streaming through windows, clean minimalist desk. Photorealistic, commercial photography style, high contrast between chaos and calm, shot with medium format camera."

**Style Notes**: Emphasize the time difference (night vs day) and emotional state through lighting and body language

## 2. RAG Architecture Visualization
**Purpose**: Show the flow of RAG system as a living, breathing entity
**Prompt**:
"Futuristic command center with a massive 3D holographic brain at the center, streams of light representing data flowing from floating document archives into the brain, then emerging as refined golden light forming answers. Business professionals standing on circular platform observing the process. Cinematic wide shot, Blade Runner 2049 color palette with blues and oranges, volumetric lighting, particle effects for data streams, hyperrealistic rendering, IMAX quality."

**Style Notes**: Focus on the organic flow of information, make it feel alive and intelligent

---

## 3. Financial AI Hallucination Risk
**Purpose**: Visualize the danger of AI providing subtly wrong financial information
**Prompt**:
"Dramatic scene of a glass bridge shattering between two modern skyscrapers, representing broken trust in financial AI. On one building, a large digital display shows '3.2%' in green, on the other '3.25%' in red. Below the breaking bridge, businessman falling with papers flying. Storm clouds gathering, lightning in background. Photorealistic 3D render, dramatic lighting, motion blur on falling elements, cinematic composition inspired by Christopher Nolan films."

**Style Notes**: Create tension through weather and breaking elements, emphasize the small but critical difference

---

## 4. Vector Search in Semantic Space
**Purpose**: Visualize how vector search finds semantically similar content
**Prompt**:
"Business professional standing in a vast cosmic space filled with floating, glowing documents arranged like constellations. Person holding a luminous question mark that sends out waves of light, causing nearby related documents to glow brighter and gravitate closer. Documents further away remain dim. Deep space background with nebula colors, realistic lighting with rim light on person, documents as translucent holograms with visible text suggestions, cinematic depth of field, inspired by Interstellar visualization."

**Style Notes**: Use distance and brightness to show semantic similarity, create sense of vast knowledge space

## 5. Traditional LLM vs RAG Parallel Systems (Slide 3)
**Purpose**: Visualize the fundamental difference between isolated LLM and RAG-enhanced systems
**Prompt**: 
"Split laboratory scene showing two AI research setups side by side. Left: Traditional LLM - scientist in white coat standing alone in sterile chamber with a single glowing AI brain floating in isolation, cold blue light, minimal information feed, looking frustrated. Right: RAG system - same scientist in warm golden light, AI brain connected to massive library of floating holographic documents via luminous neural pathways, documents actively feeding knowledge into the brain, scientist appears confident and satisfied. Professional architectural photography, shallow depth of field, warm vs cool color temperature contrast, hyperrealistic textures on lab equipment."

**Style Notes**: Emphasize isolation vs connection, use lighting temperature to convey efficiency difference

---

## 6. Embedding Process Visualization (Slide 5)
**Purpose**: Show the magical transformation of text into numerical vectors that computers can understand
**Prompt**:
"Close-up cinematic shot of Korean financial document (with readable Korean text about housing loans) transforming into streams of glowing numerical code. Document pages dissolving into golden mathematical equations and floating number arrays [0.1, 0.5, 0.9...] that spiral upward like DNA helixes. Professional photographer's hands visible at bottom of frame holding the original document. Studio lighting with dramatic shadows, macro lens with bokeh effects, particles of light representing the transformation process, commercial product photography style, 8K detail on text and numbers."

**Style Notes**: Capture the moment of transformation, make numbers feel alive and meaningful

---

## 7. Vector Database Ecosystem (Slide 8)
**Purpose**: Visualize different vector database types as distinct architectural marvels
**Prompt**:
"Aerial view of futuristic city district showing four distinct architectural structures representing different vector databases. ChromaDB: Simple modern building with clean lines and green gardens (educational). FAISS: Massive industrial complex with efficient angular design (high performance). Pinecone: Gleaming corporate headquarters with cloud connections (enterprise). Weaviate: Organic flowing structure with interconnected bridges (complex queries). Each building glows with its characteristic color, connected by flowing data streams. Drone photography perspective, golden hour lighting, photorealistic architectural visualization, professional real estate photography style."

**Style Notes**: Use architecture to convey personality and use cases of each database type

---

## 8. Query Processing and Semantic Search (Slide 10)
**Purpose**: Visualize the real-time journey of a user query through the RAG system
**Prompt**:
"Dramatic tracking shot following a glowing question bubble as it travels through a high-tech processing facility. Query starts as voice waveform, transforms into text, then into geometric vector shape, bounces through crystalline search chambers where it attracts floating document fragments like magnets, finally emerges as a polished answer gem. Korean business professional visible at start and end of the journey. Industrial sci-fi aesthetic with practical lighting, motion blur effects, particle systems, hyperrealistic materials and textures, cinematography inspired by factory automation documentaries."

**Style Notes**: Show motion and transformation, use industrial elements to convey precision and speed

## 9. Morgan Stanley Performance Transformation (Slide 12)
**Purpose**: Dramatic visualization of performance metrics improvement through visual metaphor
**Prompt**:
"Cinematic time-lapse style image showing Morgan Stanley trader transforming from overwhelmed to empowered. Starting frame: Person drowning in an ocean of paper documents, massive wall of filing cabinets, clock showing 5 hours, stressed expression. Transitioning frame: Documents transforming into streams of light. Final frame: Same person surfing confidently on a wave of organized data streams, clock showing 30 minutes, triumphant pose with arms raised. Photorealistic with dynamic motion effects, professional commercial photography, dramatic lighting with golden hour backlighting, shot with high-speed camera capturing paper-to-digital transformation."

**Style Notes**: Use water metaphors for information flow, capture the emotional journey from struggle to mastery

## 10. Next Lecture Hands-On Preview (Slide 14)
**Purpose**: Build excitement for practical implementation and real-world application
**Prompt**:
"Workshop scene showing diverse group of Korean university students and professionals collaborating around holographic displays of their RAG creations coming to life. Center: Large transparent screen showing code transforming into functional chatbot interface. Students pointing excitedly at floating AI responses, laptops showing real financial documents, coffee cups and notebooks scattered around modern co-working space. Natural lighting through large windows, authentic documentary photography style, shallow depth of field focusing on the moment of discovery and achievement, Canon 5D Mark IV professional documentation photography."
